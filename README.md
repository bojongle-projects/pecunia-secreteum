# Pecunia Secretum

# ðŸ‘€Â Problem

I am enraged by the fast-money mindset. The desire to live the Andrew Tate lifestyle is embarrassing to me.

I hate the empty life these people aspire to live out. Orgys and Lambos unfortunately are not everything. 

Background/Context

- Fast money mindset is the mindset of looking for any get rich quick scheme
- Often time these schemes are risky either financially or physically. They are almost never sustainable.
- For example, when making fraudulent purchases on someone elseâ€™s credit card you run the risk of being arrested.
- When you decide to sell cocaine, you are running the risk of legal consequences but also run the risk of encountering consequences from other distributors

# ðŸ’­Â Proposal

The plan is to create a money printer

A Dogecoin mining botnet orchestrator

This program will be designed to find active hosts on a network and begin mining dogecoin on them, all machines will dispense the currency into one wallet

The hypothetical outline for the programs functionality would look something like this

1. scan a network for all active hosts using Nmap
2. Scan for and register the operating systems of all active hosts on a network
3. Check each live host with the list of miner install scripts to see if the host is compatible with any of the install scripts on hand
4. transfer correct file to the host file via FTP
